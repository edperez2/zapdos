/*
This acceleration scheme is based on Equation 25 in paper
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1116/1.587101 with a gamma of 1.0.

The idea behind this acceleration is to calculate the average
rate of change of a given density for a specified number of
cycles and then increase the current density by the average
rate of charge times an accelerated amount of time.

This method is meant to accelerate the initial conditions to
a better initial conditions near the beginning of the simulation.
